  //     "I've had the pleasure of staying in numerous Airbnbs across countries, but Siri‚Äôs been one of the most helpful, warm, and accommodating host I've ever encountered. Our experience with Siri was exceptional from the get go.We had to evacuate during typhoon Carina, and we were fortunate to find her listing available. Despite our last-minute request, she was quick to confirm our stay, making the stressful situation much more manageableThe check-in process was seamless, and our stay was nothing short of amazing. Truly, our home away from home! Our 1-year-old mini poodle, Ragnar, surely enjoyed the plushies provided. Despite bringing his own toys, he quickly found new favorites among the ones Siri had prepared.Siri's hospitality made our stay memorable. If only we could have stayed longer! We highly recommend her place ‚Äì a thousand percent. ü©∂",

      "The place was immaculate! Just like in the photos. Was my most comfortable stay. I realized I left my Anker charger in the bnb the day after I checked out and it was delivered as soon as the next guest had checked out. Very thankful for that! I will most definitely be back here!",

      "This is my go-to place whenever I'm in Quezon City. It's always clean, smells great, and is even more beautiful in person. The location in Eastwood is perfect‚Äîgreat restaurants and everything I need are just around the corner! Siri is incredibly friendly and always goes out of her way to make sure I'm well taken care of. Highly recommended!",

  //     "Had a perfect weekend at Kirei House ‚Äî a relaxing haven right in the heart of the city. I loved the aesthetic and thoughtful design. Check-in was seamless, and the place had everything we needed ‚Äî from toothbrushes and slippers to a hairdryer and even a steam iron.Siri and Toti are fantastic hosts ‚Äî super responsive and know the good restaurants and cafes nearby if you're not sure where to go. Staying in was hard to resist tho, so we decided to cook on our 2nd day instead of eating out. To our surprise, the kitchen had everything we needed too. We didn‚Äôt get a chance to use the building amenities, but the pool looked great, and there was a parking space available as well.I guess the only downside is that I don‚Äôt actually live here lol. Will definitely book again and recommend this place to family and friends.Thank you, Kirei House!",

      "We held my bridal shower here and had a wonderful time! The place was clean, and the interior had such a relaxing vibe. It had everything we needed from utensils and toiletries to laundry essentials. If we ever have errands in QC again, we‚Äôd definitely book this place. As a bonus, the host was very responsive and accommodating to our requests!",

      "The place really deserves the title of Muji House with its minimalistic yet elegant design with the right touch of Japanese elements. It really felt like home that even my 2 pets, Moonshine and Sunbeam, felt at home the moment we got there. Also, there are many great restaurants and convenience stores around the area which made our stay hassle-free. Perfect for a staycation with loved ones (furbabies included) üíñ",
